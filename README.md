# XMP Guide

## Introduction

XMP or Extreme Memory Profiles, is an Intel technology that allows you to change multiple memory settings by simply selecting a different profile, taking advantage of higher than standard memory speeds. If you’ve ever wanted to overclock your memory but didn’t want to fiddle with frequency to avoid being unstable in Genshin, voltage and timings, this is the way to do it in order to be Genshin stable.
